# Space-survivor-scratch-project
A scratch project made for CS50 2023 week 0

To begin load up scratch and open “Space survivor.sb3”. Survive as long as you can against the endless onslaught of falling asteroids while you shoot down asteroids to 
score a point. Use the arrow keys to fly left, right, up and down, click the space-bar to shoot bullets from your spaceship. You have one life and 5 bullets. If you use 
up a bullet it will take a second to recover it but if you lose the life then its all over, 

good luck captain.
